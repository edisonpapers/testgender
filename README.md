According the the 1793 Patent Act, patent applicants were required to be U.S. citizens, and African Americans gained that long overdue right in 1868, with the passage of the ==14th Amendment=={Q188116}. Only a few Black women inventors received patents between the end of the Civil War and 1900. As Black women were barred from all opportunities or spaces neither because of formal segregation or other political and social circumstances, their obstacles in the inventive world were also coupled with the legal and cultural climate at the time. Facing the intersectionality of race, gender, and often class, as their other statutes most likely relegated them to low-paying positions and roles, Black women inventors faced defiance at every step of the inventive process.
