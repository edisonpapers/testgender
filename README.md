## Introduction

According the the 1793 Patent Act, patent applicants were required to be U.S. citizens, and African Americans gained that long overdue right in 1868, with the passage of the ==14th Amendment=={Q188116}. Only a few Black women inventors received patents between the end of the Civil War and 1900. As Black women were barred from all opportunities or spaces neither because of formal segregation or other political and social circumstances, their obstacles in the inventive world were also coupled with the legal and cultural climate at the time. Facing the intersectionality of race, gender, and often class, as their other statutes most likely relegated them to low-paying positions and roles, Black women inventors faced defiance at every step of the inventive process.

## Martha Jones

Martha Jones was the first Black woman to receive a U.S. patent in 1868, the same year that the 14th Amendment was passed. Her patent for an improvement in corn huskers that enabled the “husking, shelling, cutting up the husks, and separating them from grain in one operation.” [^1]  She understood that corn husks could be reused to feed farm animals, recognizing the economic benefit. Not much else is known about the life of Martha Jones, beyond her recognition as the first Black woman inventor in the U.S.. But that recognition represents the genius and ingenuity of countless Black women who were never acknowledged.

## Ellen Eglin (1836-1916)

Initially working as a housekeeper, before moving on to become a clerk in a census office, ==Ellen Eglin=={Q16974499} developed the clothes wringer in 1888. While the invention and development of the project was entirely her own, Eglin describes why she had to sell the invention for $18, an incredibly low sum, to someone who would profit extensively from her invention.. She told *The Woman Inventor* that, “...if it was known that a negro woman patented the invention, white ladies would not buy the wringer…”, Eglin was well aware of the animosity between White women and Black women as well as how that affected their perceived relations and interactions with each other. Eglin believed that the only way her invention would succeed would be if somebody else bought it and then passed it as their own. In a strategic move to distance herself from the invention, Eglin exemplifies the ways in which some inventors had to make difficult decisions about their inventions. Her invention was created out of pure desire to solve a problem and not out of economic want or need. Eglin committed a truly selfless act by selling the patent, not in an effort to generate revenue, but rather to provide an invaluable invention to the domestic household sector.
